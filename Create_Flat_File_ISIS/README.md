# MAD-X/PTC example of how to create a PTC Flat File for PTC-PyORBIT lattice definition.

- This is an example of how to generate a PTC flat file from PTC within MAD-X. The PTC flat file is read by PTC-PyORBIT as the lattice definition.

- To run with madx (executable provided in the folder above) to generate a PTC flat file readable by PyORBIT: ` ../madx-linux64_v5_02_00 < Create_PTC_flat_file.madx`

- To run with cpymad within a Jupyter Notebook, install Jupyter and use the command: ` jupyter notebook Instructions.ipynb &`
